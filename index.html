                <p>I thought I knew a good deal about how HTML and CSS work together but the pace of the class quickly surpassed the amount of knowledge I have gained in the past year or so of writing and modifying it. That being said, I feel like I know exponentially more than I did.</p>

                <p>The first assignment taught me that naming conventions are so important. That was the only saving grace for me to be able to complete that assignment. I could see the patterns in the naming convention Ryan used and alongside that, it helped me to see the styles that were matched with those names and recognize how those certain styles were applied to the different elements used in the assignment. </p>

                <p>The second assignment taught me that I knew nothing of about floats or a grid system and the third assigment helped me really nail down the knowledge I had gained from doing that assignment. I felt so much better trying to do that assignment since the knowledge was fresh on my mind. I finally felt like I wasn't guessing certain css styles to make the text on the grid item float one way or the other. Thats when I get to the point that I really feel like I know something.</p>

                <p>The fourth assignment tackled one of touchiest concepts for me because I always would shy away from trying to learn positioning but it taught me it's not as hard as I thought. I think what really drove home the concept of positioning elements was learning to give the parent element a position of relative so you could move a child element relative to its parent by giving the child the positioning property of absolute.</p>
