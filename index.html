                <p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. A sexy mistake. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.</p>

                <p>Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm generally confused most of the time. I have a dark side, too. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. Hello, Dexter Morgan. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Only you could make those words cute. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. God created pudding, and then he rested. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.</p>

                <p>It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. I've opened a door here that I regret. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. We just call it a sausage. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" No… but I'd like to be asked! As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. We just call it a sausage. Marry me.</p>
